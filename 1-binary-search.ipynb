    "You have a phone number, and you want to find the person’s name \n",

    "- Answer # takes `O(n)`\n",

    "\n",
    "You may think, “I’m only doing this for 1 out of  26 characters, so the run time should be `O(n/26)`.” A simple rule to remember is to ignore numbers that are added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided. None of these are correct big O run times: `O(n + 26)`, `O(n – 26)`, `O(n * 26)`, `O(n/26)`. They’re all the same as `O(n)`...\n",

    "\n",
    "- Binary search is a lot faster than simple search as your array gets bigger.\n",
    "- `O(log n)` is faster than `O(n)`, and it gets a lot faster once the list of items you’re searching through grows.\n",
    "- Algorithm speed isn’t measured in seconds.\n",
    "- Algorithm times are measured in terms of growth of an algorithm.\n",
    "- Algorithm times are written in big O notation."
